1. The main function contains calls to exit() (line 66) and pthread_exit()
(line 80). How will the effect of these two calls differ when they are
executed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  exit() terminates the entire process, including any threads it has created.
  pthread_exit() terminates the calling thread only, and lets any other threads within
  this process continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The main function calls pthread_join() (line 77) with the parameter
thread_return. Where does the value stored in thread_return come from when the
consumer_thread is joined? pthread_create()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  That parameter will be assigned one of the following:
    - The return value of the joining thread's function.
    - The argument passed to pthread_exit() in the joining thread.
    - The value PTHREAD_CANCELLED if the thread was cancelled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Where does the value stored in thread_return come from if the joined thread
terminated by calling pthread_exit instead of finishing normally?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. On the same call to pthread_join() (line 77), what will it do if the thread
being joined (consumer_thread, in this case) finishes before the main thread
reaches the that line of code (line 77)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. In this program, the main thread calls pthread_join() on the threads it
created. Could a different thread call pthread_join() on those threads instead?
Could a thread call pthread_join() on the main thread (assuming it knew the
main thread's thread ID - i.e.  pthread_t)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. The consumer_routine function calls sched_yield() (line 180) when there are
no items in the queue. Why does it call sched_yield() instead of just
continuing to check the queue for an item until one arrives?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
